# One Hour One Life

This repository contains analyses of public data from the indie game [One Hour One Life](http://onehouronelife.com/).

In this directory:

* `0_download`: Scripts for downloading game data. (Note: These scripts save the public log data to a folder called 'data/', which is not synced to GitHub. To run the rest of the analyses, you'll need to download the data first.)
* `1_demographics`: Tracing basic demographic information in the life logs (e.g., ages and causes of death).
